Task for position PHP junior

I decided not to use object oriented, because this is simple project so I used component based arhitecture.

For object oriented and use of mvc u can take look at my other repositorium "Diplomski".

Also password is not hashed because there is onely one admin and there is no option for creating new. so I decided to keep it this way, also there is example of hash in "Diplomski".
